Our goal is to model how age can affect an individual's response to a TBI (traumatic brain injury). -Charlie

### Description of what we would think would work best
We will test three functions: performance, TBI severity, and healing. -Elaine

Step 1: Performance

- test performance of healthy net (tbd how to test performance)

Step 2: TBI Severity

- TBI severity X will be indicated by % cell death
- measure performance after TBI

Step 3: Healing

- heal the network for Y amount of time 
- change the age for heal function and repeat for each age
