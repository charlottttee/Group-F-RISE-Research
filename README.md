### Refined Research Questions- Charlie
Our goal is to model how age can affect an individual's response to a TBI (traumatic brain injury). -Charlie

### Description of what we would think would work best
We will test three functions: performance, TBI severity, and healing. -Elaine

Step 1: Performance



- test performance of healthy net (tbd how to test performance)

Step 2: TBI Severity

- TBI severity X will be indicated by % cell death
- measure performance after TBI

Step 3: Healing

- heal the network for Y amount of time 
- change the age for heal function and repeat for each age

### Questions/Feedback/Comments - Ashna
The main issues we're dealing with right now are finding an appropriate model of a healthy net, and deciding how we're going to measure performance. We're planning to measure the level of brain activity for performance, or maybe the cell population or interconnectedness.
We probably need some help deciding on the model, or just what the requirements should be for the model we decide on.
We would also appreciate feedback on the feasibility of this, both coding-wise and time-wise in 3 weeks.
